\begin{abstract}
 Augmented reality (AR) is a growing phenomenon, it is used to enhance the natural environments 
 or situations and offer perceptually enriched experiences.
 With the help of advanced AR technology the information about the surrounding 
 real world of the user becomes interactive and digitally manipulatable.

In this project, a user-friendly, portable and platform independent AR system 
is proposed that allows users to manipulate/construct 3D virtual buildings on a
 real table-top using Web-AR so that it is accessible to everyone everywhere. Since
 it is virtual they are also free to interact with the model in real time, adding or 
 deleting parts to the building or scaling portions of it to examine it in greater detail. 

This project aims to make 3D modeling of a building easier by providing a
 natural and more intuitive interaction. It makes use of the in-built camera
 to map the digital objects into the real world with the help of markers and
 JavaScript libraries/frameworks like ThreeJs,AR.js and A-Frame.js.

 Augmented reality is a powerful way to bring the physical and digital worlds
 together. AR places digital objects and useful information into the real world 
 around us, which creates a huge opportunity to make our phones more intuitive, more helpful and a whole lot more fun.

\section{Introduction}
% TODO:3 para intro %
This paper is based on the idea to visualize the effect of natural calamities on structures ,everyone gets to know from 
this paper that instead of displaying the 2-D structures of design on a board or on auto-cad we can visualize the entire 3-D models , unlike the present 
day available AR's where the technology focuses itself only on the construction and alignment of materials this paper is here to give them the
 example of use of real life simulation of the natural calamities such as floods , drought, wind ,lighting and rain on the structural and materialistic properties of the 
 simulated designs. 
 
In the present day growing market for the use of AR technology ,many companies are adopting the new visionary towards designing of their 
products using AR and VR which may not only reduces the designing cost but also helps in the testing of many real time scenarios and effects on the products
,Ford is using the AR technology in visualizing the structural design of the new cars and is also using the stimulated effects of wind and snow on 
the engine performance ,Space travel revolutionizing company Space-x stimulates the effect of gravity and rockets orbit placement using AR, 
The Boeing is using AR to design the new Air Force One in which it stimulates the effects of engine propulsion ,and also for the core structure designing
 which is heavy in-built metal body to withstand any missile attacks on the plane. Thus simulation plays a major role in designing a perfect product and also helps 
 the company to create a keen final product with less error.

The effect of natural calamities might some times turn out to be in-calculative in terms of human and structural loss,which may not completely be eradicated but
can partially be prevented by designing a perfect structure that can withstand the massive grief causing calamities.thus simulations not only help in
estimating the effects but can also help us to prevent the disasters to be caused by such things in future. In this project the simulation of various natural phenomenons  
such as wind, earthquakes and lighting on the materialistic and structural properties of the design can help in preventing major damage causing factors.

The alignment and design of AR based models according to real-time scenarios itself takes much precision and correctness for designing.the tools
used in designing such effective structural designs and simulations are three.js, AR.js, A-Frame, Tracking.js . The various user interactive formats proposed in the
design are Gesture Recognition, Marker Tracking, 3D Object Interaction, 3D Scene Rendering.

\section{Prototype System}
% TODO: Include Open Source Libraries %
As the project should be easily accessible, We've developed it using Web Technologies so that it can run on any device that has a web browser and is not limited by OS or Hardware.
Since it is a web application no installation is required and can be accessed anywhere.


\subsection{Frameworks, Tools used for development}
\subsubsection{Three.js} Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library/API used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. Three.js uses WebGL.
\subsubsection{AR.js}AR.js is efficient Augmented Reality for the web that also works well on mobile devices too. It is all in javascript and runs in any browser with WebGL and WebRTC. 
\subsubsection{A-Frame} A-Frame is a powerful entity-component framework that provides a declarative, extensible, and composable structure to three.js.
A-Frameâ€™s core components include geometries, materials, lights, models, shadows, physics, motion capture and augmented reality.
\subsubsection{Tracking.js} The tracking.js library brings different computer vision algorithms and techniques into the browser environment. By using modern HTML5 specifications real-time color tracking, face detection, motion tracking is possible.
\subsection{Prototype Architecture}

\subsection{Modules}
With the help of advanced augmented-reality technology such as computer vision and object recognition, the information about the surrounding real world of the user becomes interactive and able to be digitally manipulated. 
\subsubsection{Marker Tracking}
Marker based AR uses a Camera and a visual marker to determine the center, orientation and range of its spherical coordinate system. Using a marker makes the application run faster as the object to detect is known before hand.
\subsubsection{Gesture Recognition}
Interaction with digital environment via hand gestures makes the experience quick and natural. Gestures to scale,manipulate or rotate the 3D Scene gives the user a sense of freedom .
\subsubsection{3D Scene Rendering}
Rendering the virtual model using webGL and mapping it on the marker. Visual artifacts like shadows, lighting, texture and distance are added to the final render that is displayed on the screen.
\subsubsection{3D Object Interaction}
The real space is used for data input, users perform gestures that is detected by the camera in real-time and the 3D virtual scene is projected onto the real environment reflecting the changes made by the user.

\subsubsection{Perspective Camera}
This camera mode is designed to mimic the way the human eye sees. It is the most common projection mode used for rendering a 3D scene. When there is camera movement the perspective of the 3D virtual scene is also changed accordingly
